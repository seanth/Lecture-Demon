-After processing raw audio, move to a "processed" subfolder
-After uploading temp video, move to a "processed" subfolder
-Add a way to give widthxheight for slate
-Don't skew subimage for slate
-Make it so 'start' meta can be on video media
-allow 'start' meta to be stacked with other meta
-Make sure color profile is RGB. Crashes trying to use greyscale
-If no explicit start given, errors out doing an theStartOffset calc
-Gentle does not like file names with "'" (like "Live's")
-Have the end meta marker be either 'end' or 'stop'
-Add ability to auto insert a demonThx slide at 'stop' mark, along with 5sec lead into it
-Improve the start slate to start of lecture so audio runs over it instead of 5 sec silence
-Allow for different font sizes for subtitles? Is that possible?
-Increase default size of embedded videos when they are smaller than slide width/height
-****Fix bug where cuts are made only if a set subtitle is added
-Cut statements before a start statement cause it to crash out
-Add a time increasing loop that automatically checks to see whether a transcript is ready
	-Need a way to see to the video is blocked because of copyright. If blocked, no transcript it generated

If providing a path to a csv ve a pptx for 4-xmlParseAlignTiming.py, --timing is False
-remove trailing spaces from subtitle text so that if they are files they will match
-allow for a duration ability when replacing audio
-code assumes "start" is "Slide1.png". Make it actually read what is in the thing file



notes:
	'stop' needs a slide present in the media column. It can't be alone
	can't use a video as starting media. The work around is to put a slide before the video, but make it very short. Do not have the video start time match the slide start time
	example video meta: video:mute;loop;duration:53.58
						duration:51.1;video:mute
						duration:74;lecture:mute
	subtitles can use the 'duration' meta
	if you don't provide a specific duration for a looping video, it will exit the loop if you put on a subtitle
	to cut, use notation like "cut":{"duration":time in seconds}
	cut example:
		../../../img_library/black.png	
						"cut":{"duration":635.009999}

##################
inserting text respects the {\an#} format. For example:
	{\an5}Some text.
	These go into the slide/media column

{\an1} bottom left
{\an2} bottom center
{\an3} bottom right
{\an4} center left
{\an5} center
{\an6} center right
{\an7} top left
{\an8} top center
{\an9} top left

Can alter font size using html tags
	Example: {/an9}<font size=10>Welcome to the Anthropocene</font>

Even if a subtitle has a duration value, an error will be throw if there is no explicit end time defined



To get duration of a video:
ffmpeg -i file.flv 2>&1 | grep "Duration"
